Compiling and Running WM

You need 'cc' and 'mpicc' for compiling.
Run the following three commands in this directory.
Note, the 1st line may take ~30 sec to compile the libraries.

Also note, the library mm_util may not compile. If this happens, 
you will need to install it manually. 

  source ./s/compile_lib
  source ./s/compile_main
  source ./s/compile_main_mm

Now, run a test to verify that WM is working:

  ./bin/wm mod ./demo/MEO_Gabor.moo ./demo/sine_dir.stm ./demo/d.rsp
