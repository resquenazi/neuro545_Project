Below are two steps:
  (1) compile the source code, and
  (2) time the execution of several simulations.

(1) Compiling - you need 'cc' and 'mpicc' for compiling.
    Run the following three commands in this directory.
    Note, the 1st line may take ~30 sec to compile the libraries.

source ./s/compile_lib
source ./s/compile_main
source ./s/compile_main_mm


(2) Now, run two timed test simulations.  
    First, a single process run.
    This could take 30-40 sec to finish.

  time ./bin/wm mod ./demo/MEO_Gabor.moo ./demo/sine_dir.stm ./demo/d.rsp

  [Please let me know what 'time' reports when this finishes.]


    Second, a multi-process run where the '-n 16' should be
    set to the number of cores on the machine being tested,
    or half the number of cores for comparison.
    This could take about 2 minutes with 16 cores.

  mpiexec -n 16 ./bin/mm modq ./demo/MEO_Gabor.moo ./demo/sine_dir_fine.stm ./demo/d.rsp

When the above command finishes, the 4th line from the bottom should
report "Total time = ..."  Please let me know what this time is.
