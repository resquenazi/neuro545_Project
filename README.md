## Background
Degenerative eye diseases are a leading cause of blindness in adults. While only limited treatment options for diseases such as age related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa exist, there have been a variety of technologies developed that attempt to restore some visual functioning. These include electronic prostheses (either cortical or retinal), optogenetics, and gene therapy. However to date only retinal prosthetic devices have been implanted in patients, with cortical implant and optogenetic clinical trials still under way.  These technologies are not likely to completely recreate normal vision, but rather provide essential visual input that can improve everyday functioning in patients. 

In normally sighted individuals, visual processing, from the retina to the early cortical areas, includes complementary firing of on and off-center cells in response to visual stimulation. If an on-center cell fires, the corresponding off-center cell is suppressed, and vice versa. While this on-off pattern of reciprocal firing originates in the retina, it remains a fundamental characteristic of the majority of cells throughout the early visual areas. Unless electrodes are small enough to target a single cell, electrical stimulation will result in on- and off-center cells being stimulated simultaneously: leading to unnatural cell population responses in early visual areas. 


In my research, we proposed a unique way to mimic this distortion. While we cannot recreate these distortions in the retina, it is possible to simultaneously stimulate on- and off-center populations in early visual cortex, at the level of V1 layer 4.
